To work on linux on windows we can use Virtual Machine - virtual box 
ubuntu is just a distributor
File sytem : tree format
/ : root directory 
$ : represents regular user 
hash sign : represents super user 
/bin : absolute path (full path)
bin : realative path
In linux we can create multiple files with the same name , using mix of underscore and upper score charachters

vim = text editor , helps to change the content of a file 
sudo apt install vim
to type anything we need to first press i 
wq : to save and exit 
:q! : does not save changes 


USERS IN LINUX
1) Regualr user : has all access in its own home directory , no permisions in other directories 
2) Root/Super User : Admin / full acess in all directories
sudo 
using sudo.su : to switch from regular user to super user , machine will consider yo as the super user , method not recomended
sudo apt.get update : will display all the available updates 
sudo apt.get upgrade : will actually download all the updates in the computer 
sudo apt install package_name
apt : helps to install softwares
3) Service User : services have their own account 

USER PERMISSIONS 
u-g-o ( u = user , g=group , o = other/public)
rwx-rwx-rwx (r = read , w = write , x = execute)


PATHS 
1) Abosolute Path : starts with / , searches the whole computer 
2) Relative Path : searches within the pwd only

CHMOD CALCULATOR 
read/write/execute , if permission yes , consider 1
else 0
acc to permissions rwx = binary form is converted to its equivalent decimal form 
for example : 
r-x rwx rw- 
equvalent binary form : 101 111 110
equivalent decimal form : 5 7 6
